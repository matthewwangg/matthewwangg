# Look who decided to show up!👋

- Hey! I'm Matt, an incoming Computer Science senior at Arizona State University and a Software Developer.
- I'm also an AI/ML Engineering intern at Honeywell
- My fields of interest are Machine Learning (particularly Deep Learning) and Software Engineering.
- This is where I showcase my work projects, personal projects, as well as document my learning and exploration.

## About Me 📌

- 🔭 I’m currently working on LeetCode and my Player Performance Prediction Model project.
- 🌱 I'm currently reading the book Artificial Intelligence Illuminated and learning about Convolutional Neural Networks.
- 💼 I'm a part of the team that develops the software for the Spatial Ecology Gateway project.
- 🤔 I'm looking for collaboration on developing a cool Capstone project idea. I'm considering something something related to Deep Learning, NLP, or Machine Learning Accelerator Design.
- 💬 Ask me about Principles of Programming Languages and Intro to Theoretical Computer Science (I've been a UGTA for both classes).

## My Projects 💡

Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

- ⚽ [Player Performance Prediction Model](https://github.com/matthewwangg/Player-Performance-Prediction)<!--: Full-stack web app with machine learning model to make predictions for the English Premier League.-->
